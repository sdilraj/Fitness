                Hi, my name is Dilraj. I am currently a San Francisco State University Student. I am currently seeking for an summer internship related to software because I am an computer science student. My hobbies are working on the computer, going to gym, and playing basketball. I have been passionate about computers since childhood. Also, I love working and trying out new softwares. Software can be thought of as the variable part of a computer and hardware the invariable part. Software is often divided into application software (programs that do work users are directly interested in) and system software (which includes operating systems and any program that supports application software). The term middleware is sometimes used to describe programming that mediates between application and system software or between two different kinds of application software (for example, sending a remote work request from an application in a computer that has one kind of operating system to an application in a computer with a different operating system).

                        Dilraj has 6 years of experience in fitness. Physical fitness is a general state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition, moderate-vigorous physical exercise, and sufficient rest.

                        Before the industrial revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the dayâ€™s activities without undue fatigue. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, and to meet emergency situations.
